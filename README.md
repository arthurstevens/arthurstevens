### Hi there! <img src="https://media.tenor.com/Og0XNCa_vo8AAAAi/qoobee-hi.gif" width="25"/>

Iâ€™m [**Arthur**](https://arthurstevens.dev/), a Computer Science student based in Norwich.

I love finding issues, devising solutions, and delivering results. I am very eager to learn and hone new skills to extend my reach.

Outside of coding and Figma, youâ€™ll find me at the gym, out for a run, or catching up on my favourite shows. I'm also immersed in the wider world of tech and the fields it touches â€” I'm a huge conversationalist, so feel free to talk to me about it!
